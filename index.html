              <p> I'm an undergraduate student at BRAC University in Bangladesh, where I'm pursuing a degree in computer science and engineering. 
                I have a strong desire to learn new things and use cutting-edge technology. As I conducted research for my blockchain thesis, I saw that my interest in Web 3.0 was growing. Additionally, I love to teach and inspire people to acquire new knowledge. I am currently a senior lecturer's undergraduate teaching assistant at my university, working with 120 enrolled students. In addition, I oversee the IT Project Coordinator at the BRACU Social Impact Lab. Here, I manage the IT projects and keep track of the objectives.</p>
