    <p> <br> Hello! Welcome to my porfolio. I am Mohammed Taher Abdullah from Bangladesh. I am currently 
        pursuing my bachelors degree at Computer Science & Engineering from BRAC University. I find my 
        passion in software development and hardware architectures.New technologies and implementations 
        always gave me a boost in my curiosity to learn things. Also, I am an undergraduate teaching assistant 
        at BRAC University. I have been teaching since I was in my Secondary School. Not only learning new things 
        but also teaching gives me immense pleasure. I have been a part of Social Impact Learning (SIL) from its inception. Here, I am right now looking to develop and deploy the softwares we
        need for our organization and working in the IT sector. I also am the Co-Founder and Content Creator at 
        <strong> <a href="https://web.facebook.com/nerdyandaa"> <em>Nerdy Andaa</em> </a> </strong>. 
        Nerdy Andaa has platforms in YouTube and Facebook where over 3 thousands members are learning topics like Basics of Python, 
        C++, Robotics, Economics, HRM, etc. Currently, I am doing my thesis on Blockchain, learning Web development and am 
        really interested to do something outside the box with this technology.
